    "\n",
    " - As in the two previous exercises, the grading scale is failed/passed/passed with honors.\n",
    " - **For a passing grade, Parts 1-3 must be complete**, and all questions in each of them should be answered. Some mistakes are allowed as long as you clearly attempt to solve all the exercises.\n",
    " - For completing Parts 1-3 and the optional bonus Part 4 sufficiently well, you will be awarded one bonus point for the exam.\n",
    " - All the cells in the finished notebook should run without crashing. Please delete unnecessary cells. As a good rule of thumb, use **\"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells\"** on your finished notebook to make sure it runs without errors and produces the expected output.\n",
    " - Comment your code to explain how it works and what you intend for it to do.\n",
    " - Answer the questions asked in the assignments in Markdown cells.\n",
    " - If you're having trouble with this exercise, try an online search first, but **don't just copy-paste code you find**. See exercise guidelines in the Moodle page of this course. If you can't find a solution to your problem, **ask for advice at the exercise sessions** or in the course discussion forum on Moodle or email oskari.s.heikkinen@utu.fi.\n",
    " - If/when you look things up during this exercise, please **cite your sources**, e.g. a link to a web page. It's better to cite too much than too little.\n",
    " - **We don't encourage using a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT while doing these exercises.** However, if you do use an LLM, be critical of its output. Understand any code the LLM produced before using the code, don't just copy-paste it. If you used one, write a short description of how you used the LLM in the context of these exercises (what was your input, how did you benefit from the output?)"

    "### Part 4 (BONUS): Filling in missing labels using clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this bonus exercise, you're given a dataset with almost all of the labels are missing. This is the starting point in semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning in general is beyond the scope of this course, but if you want you can learn more about it, starting e.g. on [the sklearn page for semi-supervised learning](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/semi_supervised.html). **This exercise does not require researching semi-supervised learning, however.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this exercise is a slightly modified version of [the seeds dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds). The features are different properties of wheat seeds. They are divided to three different classes, simply called `target1`, `target2` and `target3` here. The feature names and their data types are listed in the table below. **Use the modified dataset on Moodle, with the filename `ex3_seeds_missinglabels.csv`**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Type \n",
    "| :--- | ---: \n",
    "| Area | Numeric (float)\n",
    "| Perimeter | Numeric (float)\n",
    "| Compactness | Numeric (float)\n",
    "| Length | Numeric (float)\n",
    "| Width | Numeric (float)\n",
    "| Asymmetry Coefficient | Numeric (float)\n",
    "| Length Groove | Numeric (float)\n",
    "| Target | Categorical (nominal)\n",

    "First, visualize the first two principal components of the dataset in a scatter plot, showing the labels real for data points you were given. Try to see if the labels look like they belong in what look like clusters on the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use clustering to assign labels to the rows that have an `unknown` value for their label. Do this by first clustering all of the data, and then filling in the unknown values based on which clusters the data points with known values tend to fit in. The details of how exactly you decide which rows get assigned which label are up to you - you can get creative. Describe and justify your thought process, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use whichever clustering methods you prefer. You can cluster the data into 3 clusters because you have 3 known labels, but you could also try a higher number of clusters that you can then merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given the full labels for the dataset in a separate file called `ex3_seeds_labels.csv`. Plot the real labels next to the labels that your clustering attempts predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, compute the adjusted Rand index for labels predicted by your clustering solutions and the real labels, and display it along the scatter plots. Rand index is a measure of similarity between two partitions of a set of elements. Adjusted Rand index is corrected for chance using the maximum and expected values of Rand index. Optionally, you can learn more about the Rand index e.g. on [the Wikipedia page for Rand index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_index). Here you can simply use the `sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score` method imported at the beginning of this notebook."
